      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Limoncello is a lemon-flavored liqueur that originated in Southern
        Italy. It's particularly popular on the Amalfi Coast, where lemon trees
        are abundant. Limoncello is the second most popular liqueur in Italy
        (Campari takes the No. 1 spot) and is usually served after dinner as a
        digestivo.
